# 0x0B. SSH

## Learning Objectives
**General**
* What is a server
* Where servers usually live
* What is SSH
* How to create an SSH RSA key pair
* How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair
* The advantage of using #!/usr/bin/env bash instead of /bin/bash

## Tasks
**0. Use a private key:**
Write a Bash script that uses ssh to connect to your server using the private key ~/.ssh/holberton with the user ubuntu.

Requirements:

* Only use ssh single-character flags
* You cannot use -l
* You do not need to handle the case of a private key protected by a passphrase

**1. Create an SSH key pair:**
Write a Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.

Requirements:

* Name of the created private key must be holberton
* Number of bits in the created key to be created 4096
* The created key must be protected by the passphrase betty

**2. Client configuration file:**
Your Ubuntu Vagrant machine has an SSH configuration file for the local SSH client, letâ€™s configure it to our needs so that you can connect to a server without typing a password. Share your SSH client configuration in your answer file.

Requirements:

* Your SSH client configuration must be configured to use the private key ~/.ssh/holberton
* Your SSH client configuration must be configured to refuse to authenticate using a password
